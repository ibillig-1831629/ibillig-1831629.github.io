            The Golden Retrievers were first bred in Scotland. They are a cross breed of a Spanial and a Retriever. The two dogs were crossbred in the 1800s. They have a very high pain tolerance which means they can be very good hunters or police dogs. A last fun fact is that they hace two layers of fur.

                The Chihuahuas are the smallest breed of dogs and they most likely came from Mexico. Although they originated somewhere else, Chihuahuas are popular pets in America. Because they are so small, it is necessary to get layers or sweater for your dog if you live in a  cold climate. <two/p>
